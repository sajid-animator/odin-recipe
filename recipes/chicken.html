    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
    <ul><li>1 onion, roughly chopped</li>
    <li>2 carrots, roughly chopped</li>
<li>1 free range chicken 1.5kg</li>
<li>1 lemon halved</li>
<li>25 gram butter softened</li></ul>
<h2>RECIPE</h2>
<ul><li>Heat oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Have a shelf ready in the middle of the oven without any shelves above it.</li>
<li>Scatter 1 roughly chopped onion and 2 roughly chopped carrots over the base of a roasting tin that fits the whole 1 ½ kg chicken, but doesn’t swamp it.</li>
<li>Season the cavity of the chicken liberally with salt and pepper, then stuff with 2 lemon halves and a small bunch of thyme, if using.</li>
<li>Sit the chicken on the vegetables, smother the breast and legs all over with 25g softened butter, then season the outside with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Place in the oven and leave, undisturbed, for 1 hr 20 mins – this will give you a perfectly roasted chicken. To check, pierce the thigh with a skewer and the juices should run clear.</li>
<li>Carefully remove the tin from the oven and, using a pair of tongs, lift the chicken to a dish or board to rest for 15-20 mins. As you lift the dish, let any juices from the chicken pour out of the cavity into the roasting tin.</li>
<li>While the chicken is resting, make the gravy. Place the roasting tin over a low flame, then stir in 1 tbsp flour and sizzle until you have a light brown, sandy paste.</l>
<li>Gradually pour in 250ml chicken stock, stirring all the time, until you have a thickened sauce.</li>
<li>Simmer for 2 mins, using a wooden spoon to stir, scraping any sticky bits from the tin.</li>
<li>Strain the gravy into a small saucepan, then simmer and season to taste. When you carve the bird, add any extra juices to the gravy.</li>
</ul>
